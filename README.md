## Hi, I'm Giedrius Tamulaitis

I love technology and arts and enjoy building weird electronic devices like [interactive music device Social Sequencer](https://tamulaitis.lt/project/social-sequencer/) or [modified rotary phone that allows you to play Doom](https://tamulaitis.lt/project/dialrhea/) (which is the best game ever by the way).

[https://tamulaitis.lt](https://tamulaitis.lt) is the place where you can read about my projects music that I released and video games that I worked on. Website is also available as an open source project in [tamulaitis-page](https://github.com/GiedriusT/tamulaitis-page) GitHub repo.

I work as a technology leader so if you are here for serious stuff, let's connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giedriustamulaitis/).
